Natalia Shvedova is well known as the  editor of Ozhegov's  famous Dictionary of the Russian Language. When Ozhegov died (1964),  she continued to work on the text.  From edition to edition, she revised and extended the dictionary. This led to the release (1991)  of  a new dictionary (Defining Dictionary of the Russian Language) as the work of two authors Ozhegov and Shvedova.

Later, Ozhegov's children  filed a lawsuit for copyright infringement against  Shvedova but the expert examination  ordered by the court concluded  that "Ozhegov-Shvedova Dictionary" was the  work of   Shvedova. 

As a result, the court ruled (2004) that  Ozhegov's children had no copyrights, because Shvedova had not transfered her copyrights to  any third party. On the other hand,  Shvedova was forbidden  to use Ozhegov's name in subsequent editions of her dictionary (cf. <https://www.compromat.ru/page_20285.htm>).

Owing to her advanced age, Shvedova wasn't present at the trial and was represented by her lawyers. She died 5 years later, in her 93rd year. No  edition of her dictionary  has been published, without the name of Ozhegov as coauthor. 

Electronic versions of  Shvedova's dictionary (sometimes named  Ozhegov's Dictionary) are freely available on the internet (<http://www.speakrus.ru/dict2/index.htm>).
